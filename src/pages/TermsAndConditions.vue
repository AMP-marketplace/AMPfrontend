                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    - Retailers: Purchase from distributors or manufacturers for
                    resale.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    - Authorized Distributors: Have official permission to
                    distribute manufacturers’ products.

                <h4 class="text-weight-bold">6) Ordering & Payments</h4>
                <p>
                  We process payments securely through Paystack, our trusted
                  payment partner. We’re also working on adding more safe and
                  reliable payment options soon. Africa Medical Marketplace
                  (AMP) does not collect or hold payments directly. Instead, all
                  transactions go through secure third-party payment providers.
                  Buyers should review the seller’s terms before making a
                  purchase.

                <h4 class="text-weight-bold">7) Dispute Resolution</h4>
                <p>
                  In the event of a dispute, buyers and sellers should first
                  attempt to resolve the matter amicably. If unresolved, Africa
                  Medical Marketplace (AMP) provides a mediation service to help
                  settle disputes fairly. If no resolution is reached, the
                  dispute may be escalated to arbitration under the applicable
                  jurisdiction.
